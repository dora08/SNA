1 Write a program to compute the following for a given a network:
(i) number of edges, 
(ii) number of nodes; (
iii) degree of node; (
iv)node with lowest degree; 
(v) the adjacency list; 
(vi) matrix of the graph.

2) Perform following tasks:
(i) View data collection forms and/or import one-mode/two-mode datasets; 
(ii) Basic Networks matrices transformations

3) For a given network find the following:
(i)Length of the shortest path from a given node to another node; 
(ii) the density of the graph; 
(iii) Draw egocentric network of node G with chosen configuration parameters.

4) Compute the following node level measures:
(i) Density; 
ii) Degree; 
(iii) Reciprocity;
(iv) Transitivity; 
(v)Centralization; 
(vi) Clustering.

5) Write a program to distinguish between a network as a matrix, a network as an edge list, and a network as a sociogram (or “network graph”) using 3 distinct networks representatives of each.

6) Write a program to exhibit structural equivalence, automorphic equivalence, and regular equivalence from a network.

7)Displaying Bipartite network in the graph format.

8)Hamming distance
