Aim: Write a program to exhibit
i.	Structural equivalence
ii.	Automatic equivalence &
iii.	Regular equivalence from a network

i. Structural equivalence: It's a measure of similarity between two programs based on their structures, disregarding variable names and comments.
ii. Automatic equivalence: This refers to the capability of systems or tools to automatically determine if two programs are equivalent without human intervention, often used in software verification.
iii. Regular equivalence: This involves determining if two programs produce the same outputs for all possible inputs, typically using formal methods such as theorem proving or model checking.
