Hamming distance is a metric used to measure the difference between two strings of equal length. It calculates the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other.

library(e1071)
x <- c(0, 0, 0, 0)
y <- c(0, 1, 0, 1)
z <- c(1, 0, 1, 1)
w <- c(0, 1, 1, 1)


hamming.distance(x, y)
hamming.distance(y,z)
hamming.distance(y,w)
hamming.distance(z,w)
hamming.distance(x, w)
hamming.distance(x, z)
